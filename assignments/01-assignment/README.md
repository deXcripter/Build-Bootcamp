1st Js Assignment

JavaScript Research Assignments

1. Write a JavaScript function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, it should print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, it should print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz". Else print the number.

2. ⁠Write a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 2(even numbers). Use logical operators to perform the check.

This will help them get a hang of loops, conditional statements, functions and operators which we’d talk more on in the next class.
